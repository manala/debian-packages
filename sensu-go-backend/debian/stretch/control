Description: Sensu Go backend For Debian
 Sensu is an open source monitoring tool for ephemeral infrastructure and
 distributed applications. It is an agent based monitoring system with built-in
 auto-discovery, making it very well-suited for cloud environments. Sensu uses
 service checks to monitor service health and collect telemetry data. It also
 has a number of well defined APIs for configuration, external data input,
 and to provide access to Sensu's data. Sensu is extremely extensible and is
 commonly referred to as "the monitoring router".
