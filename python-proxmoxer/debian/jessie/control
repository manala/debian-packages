Description: Python Wrapper for the Proxmox 2.x API (HTTP and SSH)
 Wrapper around the Proxmox REST API v2. It was inspired by slumber, but it
 dedicated only to Proxmox. It allows one to use not only REST API over HTTPS,
 but the same api over ssh and pvesh utility. Like Proxmoxia it dynamically
 creates attributes which responds to the attributes you've attempted to reach.
